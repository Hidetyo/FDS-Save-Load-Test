Open "example.s" and read the comments for information about this program.

To build, run "compile_example.bat", which should produce "example.fds".

You will need cc65. You can download it from: http://www.cc65.org/
Place cc65 into a folder called "cc65" within the folder with this example.
The cc65 binaries should be in: cc65/bin/

An optional Python 3 program to build debugging symbols for FCEUX is included.
Python 3 can be downloaded at: https://www.python.org/

I recommend FCEUX for debugging.
FCEUX can be downloaded at: http://www.fceux.com/

The .dbg file produced by the linker will also provide debug symbols for
Mesen, NintendulatorDX and NESICIDE.

By default this example will skip the FDS licensing screen,
search for "BYPASS" in "example.s" for information
if you wish to restore the license.


I hope you find this example helpful!
